<section>
    <h2>{{page.header}}</h2>
    {{content}}
</section>

<!-- a diatribe is what we're going to call the general content under a section header from a pretty heckin' website.  -->

<!--
    Since we can pass a fair amount into markdown, need to come up with solutions for:
        -Meter
        -Progress
        -details
        -asides

    Beyond that, we'll make our design like a book, where we browse the table of contents.  So we'll want to create some browser logic
    and some sort of jump to section functionality (optgroup select?).  We might drop the aside's functionality where it alternates position
    on a designated paragraph, but the idea is to show some fidelity to the source while making a jekyll template.
