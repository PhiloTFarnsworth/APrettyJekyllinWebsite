## Foreword

A Pretty Jekyllin' website is a proving ground for some basic [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) framework customization for use with [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).  While the basic templates encourage usage for websites like blogs, I though it would be an interesting to build a template that would work like a book or manual.  

See the original [A Pretty Heckin' Website](https://philotfarnsworth.github.io/APrettyHeckinWebsite/)

    <p>
        We've broken out of the intended static site design with A Pretty Jekyllin' Website, using javascript to serve our files in a central view screen.  Since Jekyllin' serves mostly unstyled files from our urls that we fetch from, we forgo building an SPA history mimic function and instead track this information in our navigation area in the header above.  I've added a build utility in Jekyll, A Pretty Jekyllin' Website still runs the same lightweight front end, now enhanced by allowing users to load content in bite sized chunks and more importantly, if they find the content boring, they can quit reading without having loaded the entirety of this website based screed.  While there's still some warts from preserving our original flex layout from A Pretty Heckin' Website, the rest of code could be easily adapted and applied to any Jekyll based website.
