Every website should look like this, and any which do not conform should be removed from the internet
with extreme prejudice. But on a more serious note, minding these standard <abbr>HTML</abbr> patterns can
help make your webpages more accessible and functional. This site can also be used to measure CSS designs
with by modifying the div and div#flexRows to be assigned to create columns and rows respectively. Since
you've already seen it in the superior form, you can compare and see where the prospective layout may falter.
